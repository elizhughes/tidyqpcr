\title{Remove baseline from amplification curves (BETA)}
\usage{
debaseline(plateamp, maxcycle = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{plateamp}{data frame with plate amplification data, including variables
well, cycle, fluor_raw (raw fluorescence value), and program_no. Assume
program 2 for amplification curves from Roche LightCycler format data.}

\item{maxcycle}{maximum cycle value to use for baseline, before
amplification.}
}
\value{
platemap with additional columns per well:
\tabular{ll}{
  fluor_base      \tab baseline /background value  \cr
  fluor_signal    \tab normalized fluorescence signal, 
  i.e. fluor_raw - fluor_base
  }
}
\description{
Remove baseline from qPCR amplification curves
by subtracting median of initial cycles.
}
\details{
BETA function version because:

- assumes Roche LightCycler format,
we should ideally replace "program_no == 2" by something more generic?

- the rule-of thumb "baseline is median of initial 10 cycles"
has not been tested robustly
