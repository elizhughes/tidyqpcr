\title{Label a plate with sample and probe information}
\usage{
label_plate_rowcol(plate, rowkey = NULL, colkey = NULL, coercefactors = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{plate}{tibble (data frame) with variables well_row, well_col, well.
This would usually be produced by create_blank_plate(). It is possible to
include other information in additional variables.}

\item{rowkey}{tibble (data frame) describing plate rows, with variables
well_row and others.}

\item{colkey}{tibble (data frame) describing plate columns, with variables
well_col and others.}

\item{coercefactors}{if TRUE, coerce well_row in rowkey and well_col in
colkey to factors}
}
\value{
tibble (data frame) with variables well_row, well_col, well, and
  others.

  This tibble contains all combinations of well_row and well_col found in the
  input plate, and all information supplied in rowkey and colkey distributed
  across every well of the plate. Return plate is ordered by row well_row
  then column well_col.

  Note this ordering may cause a problem if well_col is supplied as a
  character (1,10,11,...), instead of a factor or integer (1,2,3,...). For
  this reason, the function by default converts well_row in `rowkey`, and
  well_col in `colkey`, to factors, taking factor levels from `plate`, and
  warns the user.

  Other tidyqpcr functions require plate plans to contain variables
  sample_id, target_id, and prep_type, so `label_plate_rowcol` will warn if
  any of these are missing. This is a warning, not an error, because these
  variables can be added by users later.
